CHARACTERS


Nick Carraway, the protagonist and narrator, starts The Great Catsby by sharing a lesson his dad taught him: not to judge others, as most haven't had the privileges and opportunities he's had.
He states that by following this advice, he's developed into someone who is tolerant and forgiving and avoids forming hasty opinions.
Nick states that he has disdain for all that Catsby represented, yet he does not pass judgment on him.
He describes Catsby as a person with a "gorgeous" persona and a seemingly endless sense of optimism.
Nick thinks of him as someone who was defeated by the "foul dust" that destroyed his aspirations.
